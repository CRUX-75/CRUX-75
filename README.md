## 🚀 About Me

A few years ago, I grew frustrated with the traditional marketing industry. Everyone was selling the same formulas: "more clicks, more leads, more magic." But behind the noise, real, scalable results were missing. I decided to build what I couldn't find: **intelligent systems that actually work.**

Today, I am an **AI Automation Architect** specializing in **agentic AI systems**. I don't just "automate tasks"; I design self-improving engines that create, publish, and learn autonomously. I blend my background as a **Certified Online Marketing Manager** with AI engineering to transform business problems into robust, production-grade software solutions.

As **CEO of Genflow Automation**, my mission is to free professionals from repetitive work, giving them back the time to create, innovate, and grow.

## 🗺️ Technical Roadmap: From Automation to Autonomous Agency

The Botanery project follows a phased sprint plan to evolve from a content generator into an AI-driven "Growth Engine."

### 🟢 Phase 1: Robust Foundations (Completed)
* **Sprint 0-2**: Infrastructure setup (Node.js + Supabase + Sharp).
* **Sprint 3**: Meta Graph API integration for automated publishing.
* **Sprint 3.1**: Intelligent Image Composition (SVG templates & dynamic branding).

### 🟡 Phase 2: Feedback & Intelligence (Current Focus)
* **Sprint 4 (A1 Collector)**: Real-time metrics ingestion (Likes, Saves, Reach).
* **Sprint 5 (A2 Scoring)**: Implementing performance scoring per product/style.
* **Sprint 6 (A3 Optimizer)**: Activating the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm for autonomous content selection based on ROI.

### 🔵 Phase 3: Advanced Content & Scaling (Future)
* **Sprint 9**: Automated Seamless Carousels (10-slides storytelling).
* **Sprint 10**: AI Video/Reels generation via Remotion/FFmpeg.
* **Sprint 11**: Ads Automation MVP — Turning organic winning posts into paid ads automatically.

### 🚀 Phase 4: Business Expansion
* Integration with Shopify/Zoodrop for real-time inventory-aware posting.
* White-label architecture for multi-tenant "Content Agent as a Service."

## 🏗️ Featured Project: Botanery Content Agent

**Botanery** is an autonomous, closed-loop content system designed for e-commerce. Unlike simple linear workflows, this agent makes data-driven decisions to manage the entire content lifecycle for a brand.

### System Architecture

This system utilizes a **Job-Queue architecture** with strict separation of concerns, ensuring the creation process is fault-tolerant and highly scalable.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Persistence & Queue"
        DB[(Supabase DB)] -- "Fetch Pending Jobs" --> Worker
        Worker -- "Update Status / Log Results" --> DB
    end

    subgraph "Execution Layer (Node.js)"
        Worker[Main Node.js Worker]
    end

    subgraph "Intelligence & Creative"
        Worker -- "Prompt & Context" --> LLM[OpenAI / Midjourney]
        LLM -- "Generated Assets" --> Worker
    end

    subgraph "Distribution"
        Worker -- "Publish Content" --> Meta[Meta Graph API]
        Meta -- "Media ID" --> Worker
    end

    subgraph "Learning Loop"
        Collector[Metrics Collector] -- "Get Engagement" --> Meta
        Collector -- "Store Signals" --> DB
        DB -- "Optimize Selection" --> Worker
    end

    style DB fill:#00dfd8,stroke:#333
    style Collector fill:#ffcc00,stroke:#333
```

### Key Features

- **🤖 Fully Autonomous**: No manual intervention required
