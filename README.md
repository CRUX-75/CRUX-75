## 🚀 About Me

A few years ago, I got frustrated with the marketing industry. Everyone was selling the same formulas — "more clicks, more leads, more magic." But behind all that noise, real results were missing. So I decided to build what I couldn't find: **intelligent systems that actually work.**

Today, I am an **AI Automation Architect** specializing in **agentic AI systems**. I don't just "automate tasks"; I design self-improving engines that create, publish, and learn autonomously. [cite_start]I blend my background as a **Certified Online Marketing Manager (E-commerce Focus)** with hands-on AI engineering to turn business problems into robust software solutions[cite: 8, 9].

As **CEO of Genflow Automation**, my mission is to free professionals from repetitive work, giving them back the time to create and grow.

## 🧠 What I Build

### **Agentic AI Systems**
Autonomous content and workflow engines using **LangGraph**, **Node.js**, and a robust **Job-Queue architecture**.

### **Feedback Intelligence & Learning Loops**
Closed-loop systems that don't just post content, but measure performance (via Meta Insights) to adapt strategy automatically.

### **Enterprise-Grade E-Commerce Automation**
AI-driven product selection, scheduling, and multi-channel optimization (Social Media + Marketplaces).

* **Architecture**: Modular system with separation of concerns: `Worker` (execution) and `Collector` (metrics).
* **Tech**: Node.js, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Meta Graph API, OpenAI SDK.
* **Logic**: Real-time status tracking (`pending`, `completed`, `failed`) ensuring 100% reliability.
